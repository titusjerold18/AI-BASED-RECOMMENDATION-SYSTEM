## This AI-based Recipe Recommendation System is a smart web backend developed using Java, Spring Boot, and Apache Mahout. It provides personalized recipe suggestions using user-based collaborative filtering and also supports ingredient-based filtering to help users find recipes based on what they have. The system reads user ratings and recipe data from CSV files and generates tailored recommendations through Mahoutâ€™s machine learning engine. Users can get suggestions like "Pasta" based on their previous activity or request filtered results like "Omelette" by entering ingredients such as "egg" and "onion." Built with Maven and structured to allow easy frontend integration (e.g., React), this project is ideal for showcasing recommender system skills in resumes, academic submissions, or internship portfolios.
